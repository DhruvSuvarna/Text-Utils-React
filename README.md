This Project was only made as an initial practice model when learing React Js.

React is really a cool thing to work with as it makes a lot of things convenient. 

It helps me to keep my code note neat and clean as well as organize my files properly and reuse any components which I have built.

So I highly recommend everyone to learn React as it really great.

In this project I haven't used React Routing concepts as they are incompatible with Github Pages (You will get some issues while hosting this website on github if Routing is used)

Although those issues can be solved but it takes some time, which I didn't want to invest at that time.

This web App is also quite simple in design and easy to understand for the users.

Feel free to fork this repository and make any further improvements in it.
